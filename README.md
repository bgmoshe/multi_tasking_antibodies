# Introduction

This repository implements the algorithm in "Multi-task learning for predicting SARS-CoV-2 antibody escape" by Barak Gross and Prof. Roded Sharan.
In the paper, the authors aim to prove that using multi-task learning on antibody recognition is a useful paridigm that should get more attention.
For any problems or questions regarding the code, please email barak_gross@mail.tau.ac.il.

# Strcture
The repository contains several folders:
* data - contains two folders: modified and original. Original is the csv we pulled from other sources such as other studies, while modified contains aggregation of them in order to be able to read them more comfortably.
* code - contains the needed code to run to produce the outputs for the #TODO: elaborate

# How to Run

TODO: Add snippet of example of running
